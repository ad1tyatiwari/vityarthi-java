# Student Record Manager
## Project Overview

Domain classes (edu.ccrm.domain)

Model the real-world objects such as Course, Student, Instructor, Semester, Enrollment, and associated information (grades, person).

Each class probably has properties (fields) and getter/setter methods.

Service classes (edu.ccrm.service)

Implement business logic for course handling (CourseService) and student handling (StudentService).

These services operate on the domain objects.

Main.java

The program's entry point.

Probably instantiates objects, invokes services, and executes a basic workflow (e.g., registering a student, grading, etc.).

## Features
#### Student Management
Easy Student management with the CLI interface providing CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) Operations.

#### Exception handling
Provding Exception handling for all the operations so the reliability is really high.

#### Data Backups
Data Backups provides a sense of relief and safe guards the data from getting accidental deletion.
